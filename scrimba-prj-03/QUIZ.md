## Q1

1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.


3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).


4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Unchanging. Props are immutable. State is mutable.

## Q2

1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   
a. New value of state (setCount(42))
b. Callback function - whatever the callback function 
   returns === new value of state


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
Whenever you don't need the previous value of state to determine
what the new value of state should be.


3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
Whenever you DO need the previous value to determine the new value

## Q3 -- useEffect

1. What is a "side effect" in React? What are some examples?
- Any code that affects an outside system.
- local storage, API, websockets, two states to keep in sync


2. What is NOT a "side effect" in React? Examples?
- Anything that React is in charge of.
- Maintaining state, keeping the UI in sync with the data, 
  render DOM elements


3. When does React run your useEffect function? When does it NOT run
   the effect function?
- As soon as the component loads (first render)
- On every re-render of the component (assuming no dependencies array)
- Will NOT run the effect when the values of the dependencies in the
  array stay the same between renders


4. How would you explain what the "dependecies array" is?
- Second paramter to the useEffect function
- A way for React to know whether it should re-run the effect function
